/**
 * Everything the Blueprint SAYS, in plain words. The scanner (scan.ts) finds what EXISTS.
 *
 * - Each story has two versions: s = simple, e = engineer.
 * - Never type a number here. Write {{factName}} and the scanner fills it in from the code, so the
 *   text cannot go out of date. (tests/blueprint.test.ts enforces this. O2, pO2, 3D and `code` are fine.)
 * - When you add a page, API route, tool, engine, lib module, shell component or dependency, add its
 *   story here. Until you do, the page marks it "new, not explained yet" and the test fails.
 *
 * Mini format: **bold** and `code`.
